# SimpleNavigation
My implementation of simple navigation system using google maps.
Using BFS, Dijkstra and A Star searching algorithms.
This was a part of my assigment to course.

Methods implemented by me are in classes:

/ implementation of graph list and matrix/
package .basicgraph
GraphAdjList.java
GraphAdjMatrix.java

/implementation of graph representing points and roads on map/
package .roadgraph
EdgeNode.java
GraphNode.java

/this class contains implementation of bfs, dijkstra and A star algorithms/
MapGraph.java

GUI was provided by examinator Team.
